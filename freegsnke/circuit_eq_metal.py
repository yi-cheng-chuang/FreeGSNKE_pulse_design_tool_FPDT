    """
    Time evolution model for electrical currents in conducting structures
    within a tokamak (active coils, passive vessel, and optional plasma coupling).

    This class solves the dynamical circuit equations for metallic components
    using an implicit-Euler time integrator. It can operate in multiple modes:

    - Coil-only (vacuum vessel response)
    - Vessel eigenmode representation of passive structures
    - Fully coupled plasma–metal system (optional)

    The system evolves currents in a reduced basis determined by:
    - physical active coil currents
    - vessel eigenmodes (if enabled)
    - optional plasma current coupling

    Key features:
    - Construction of resistance and inductance operators
    - Optional diagonalisation of passive vessel dynamics
    - Optional coupling to plasma current evolution
    - Support for multi-step implicit time integration

            multiple internal steps if larger than `max_internal_timestep`.
        plasma_pts : array-like, optional
            Grid points included in plasma evolution coupling (typically points

        Active coil variables are always included. Passive vessel modes are selected
