class Probes:
    """
    Representation of magnetic diagnostics for a tokamak equilibrium.

    This class implements synthetic magnetic probe signals, including:

    - Flux loops: measure poloidal flux ψ(R, Z)
    - Pickup coils: measure magnetic field components projected onto a
      probe orientation vector (B · n̂)

    The signals are computed from contributions of both coil currents and
    plasma current distributions via precomputed Green's functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coils_dict : dict
        Dictionary describing active (and possibly passive) coils, including
        geometry and identifiers used for Green's function evaluation.

    magnetic_probe_data : dict, optional
        Dictionary containing pre-defined probe configurations. Must include
        keys:
            - "flux_loops"
            - "pickups"

    magnetic_probe_path : str, optional
        Path to a pickled file containing `magnetic_probe_data`.

    Notes
    -----
    Exactly one of `magnetic_probe_data` or `magnetic_probe_path` must be
    provided. If both are given, a ValueError is raised. If neither is
    provided, no probe geometry is initialised.

    Attributes
    ----------
    floops : dict
        Flux loop definitions (positions, identifiers, etc.).
    pickups : dict
        Pickup coil definitions (positions, orientations, etc.).
    coil_names : list of str
        Ordered list of coil identifiers.
    coils_dict : dict
        Copy of input coil dictionary.

    Other Attributes
    -----------------
    The class also stores multiple Green's function caches used to compute:

    - Flux loop signals from coils and plasma
    - Pickup coil signals (Br, Bz projections)
    - Combined diagnostic outputs

    These are populated during later setup routines.

        Initialise probe geometry and precompute Green's functions for a given
        equilibrium configuration.

        This method validates compatibility between the probe set and the supplied
        equilibrium, then constructs all probe-related quantities (positions,
        orientations, and Green's function caches) required for synthetic
        diagnostic evaluation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        eq : Equilibrium
            Equilibrium object providing tokamak geometry, coil configuration,
            and (optionally) plasma state information.

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If the coil configuration in `eq.tokamak` does not match the coil
            configuration used to define the probes.

        Notes
        -----
        This routine performs expensive precomputation of Green's functions and
        should typically be called once per equilibrium setup.

        Flux Loops
        ----------
        - Extracts flux loop positions and ordering from `self.floops`
        - Computes coil contribution Green's functions:
            `greens_psi_coils_floops`
        - Computes plasma contribution Green's functions:
            `greens_psi_plasma_floops` (cached per equilibrium key)

        Pickup Coils
        -------------
        - Extracts pickup positions and orientation vectors
        - Computes coil contributions:
            `greens_br_coils_pickup`, `greens_bz_coils_pickup`
        - Computes oriented magnetic field responses:
            `greens_B_coils_oriented`, `greens_B_plasma_oriented`

        Caching
        -------
        All plasma-dependent Green's functions are stored in dictionaries keyed by
        an equilibrium identifier (`eq_key`) to avoid recomputation when possible.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            All results are stored in-place as object attributes.

        - The ordering of currents is determined by `self.coil_names`, which is

        """
        Compute the magnetic field projection (B · n) at pickup probes.

        This function evaluates the total magnetic field at pickup locations
        and projects it onto the local probe orientation vector n.

        The total pickup signal is composed of three contributions:

            (B · n)_j = (B_coil · n)_j + (B_plasma · n)_j + (B_tor · n)_j

        where:
            - j indexes pickup probes
            - coil and plasma terms are computed using precomputed oriented
            Green's functions
            - the toroidal field contribution is projected via the pickup
            orientation component in the toroidal direction

        Parameters
        ----------
        eq : object
            Equilibrium object containing coil currents, plasma currents,
            and magnetic field profiles.
        probe : str, optional
            Probe set at which the signal is evaluated.
            Currently only "pickups" is implemented (default).

        Returns

        signal : ndarray
            Scalar pickup signal (B · n) at each probe location,
            shape (n_probes,).
