def Myy(plasma_pts):
    """
    Compute the mutual inductance matrix between plasma grid points.

    The matrix is constructed using the Green's function evaluated between
    all pairs of plasma points in cylindrical (R, Z) coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plasma_pts : ndarray, shape (N, 2)
        Array of plasma grid point coordinates in cylindrical geometry:
        - plasma_pts[:, 0] = R coordinates
        - plasma_pts[:, 1] = Z coordinates

    Returns
    -------
    Myy : ndarray, shape (N, N)
        Mutual inductance matrix between all plasma grid points.
        The matrix is symmetric.

    Notes
    -----
    The matrix is computed as:

        Myy_ij = 2π * G(R_i, Z_i, R_j, Z_j)

    where G is the Green's function returned by `Greens`.

def grid_greens(R, Z):
    """
    Compute the Green's function matrix for a structured (R, Z) grid.

    This function evaluates the Green's function between a set of radial
    grid points and an axially discretised Z-grid, using broadcasting to
    construct all pairwise interactions efficiently.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : ndarray, shape (N, M)
        Radial grid values. Only the first column is used (R[:, 0]).
    Z : ndarray, shape (N, M)
        Axial grid values defining a uniform Z spacing.

    Returns
    -------
    ggreens : ndarray
        Green's function evaluated on the expanded grid, scaled by 2π.
        Shape depends on broadcasting of the underlying `Greens` function.

    Notes
    -----
    - The Z-grid is assumed to be uniformly spaced in the second dimension.
    - The spacing is computed as:
          dz = Z[0, 1] - Z[0, 0]
    - The number of Z points is inferred as:
          nZ = Z.shape[1]
    - The Green's function is evaluated as:
          G(R_i, z_k, R_j, z=0)
      where the axial coordinate for the second argument is constructed as:
          z_k = dz * arange(nZ)

    Warning
    -------
    - Only `R[:, 0]` is used; any variation in R across the second dimension is ignored.
    - Assumes uniform spacing in Z; non-uniform grids will produce incorrect results.
