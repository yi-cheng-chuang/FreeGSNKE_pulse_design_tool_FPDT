class VirtualCircuitsController:
    """
    A controller class for managing virtual circuit control matrices and coil current reference
    waveforms.

    This class supports both spline-based (linear) and step-based interpolation of control signals
    for coils and plasma shaping parameters. It optionally integrates with a virtual
    circuit provider for enhanced control capabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : dict
        A nested dictionary containing control waveforms for each shape parameter to be controlled.
        Each shape parameter's dictionary must include keys for both spline-based and step-based parameters:
            - Spline keys: typically of the form '<coil>_ref'
            - Step keys: typically shape target and plasma target names
        Each key should map to a dictionary suitable for interpolation, with keys:
            - 'times': 1D array of time points
            - 'vals': 1D array of values at those time points (same length).

    ctrl_coils : list of str
        The list of active coils being controlled.

    ctrl_targets : list of str
        The list of shape parameters being managed.

    plasma_target : list of str
        The list of plasma parameters being managed.

    vc_generator : object, optional
        An optional class object for updating virtual circuits during simulation. If not
        provided, deafult waveform-defined VCs will be used. Its `vc_update_rate`
        attribute (set when the generator was initialised) controls how often, in
        seconds, new VCs are computed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    interpolant_derivatives : dict
        Derivatives of the coil-reference spline interpolants, rebuilt whenever
        `update_interpolants` is called and reused during control steps.

    """

        """
        Initialise the virtual circuits controller.

        Reads the coil ordering used by the virtual circuit matrices,
        validates that the required per-coil reference data and per-target
        (shape and plasma) data are present in `data`, stores a reference to
        the data, and builds the spline/step interpolants used to evaluate
        them at arbitrary times. Optionally sets up state for a
        virtual circuit generator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : dict
            Dictionary of time-series entries, plus a "coil_order" entry.
            Must contain:

            - "coil_order" : list of str giving the ordering of `ctrl_coils`
            used in the virtual circuit matrices. Not validated via
            `check_data_entry` (not a time-series entry).
            - "<coil>_ref" for each coil in `ctrl_coils` : reference signal
            for that coil.
            - one entry per name in `ctrl_targets` and `plasma_target` :
            target values, each in the format expected by
            `check_data_entry` (i.e. containing 'times' and 'vals' arrays
            of matching length).
        ctrl_coils : list of str
            Names of the coils used for shape control. Determines which
            "<coil>_ref" keys are required in `data`.
        ctrl_targets : list of str
            Names of the shape parameters to be controlled. Determines
            which additional keys are required in `data`.
        plasma_target : list of str
            Names of the plasma parameter(s) to be controlled. Determines
            which additional keys are required in `data`.
        vc_generator : object, optional
            Virtual circuit generator. If provided, enables automatic VC
            updating (see Attributes). If None, this
            controller uses existing VC schedule. Its
            `vc_update_rate` attribute controls how often VCs are
            updated, in seconds.

        Attributes
        ----------

            Coil ordering used by the virtual circuit matrices, taken from
            `data["coil_order"]`.

            entry per coil in `ctrl_coils`.
        keys_to_step : list of str
            Data keys that will be step-interpolated: `ctrl_targets` +
            `plasma_target`.
        data : dict
            Internal reference to the input `data`.
        vc_generator : object or None
            Stored copy of `vc_generator`.
        latest_vc_time : None
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Placeholder for the
            timestamp of the most recently computed virtual
            circuit.
        latest_vc : None
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Placeholder for the most
            recently computed virtual circuit.
        jacobian_list : list
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Accumulated shape
            (Jacobian) matrices used to generate each virtual circuit in
            `vc_list` (same order/indexing), read from
            `vc_generator.latest_shape_matrix` after each recomputation. `None`
            for entries where `vc_generator` does not expose this attribute.
        vc_list : list
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Accumulated
            virtual circuits.
        vc_times : list
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Timestamps corresponding
            to `vc_list` and `jacobian_list`.
        full_vc_matrix : list
            Only set if `vc_generator` is provided. Accumulated full virtual
            circuit matrix.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a required key is missing from `data` or is not in the
            expected format, as enforced by `check_data_entry`. Also raised
            if `data["coil_order"]` and `ctrl_coils` do not contain the same
            set of coils.
        KeyError
            If `data` does not contain a "coil_order" entry.

        Notes
        -----
        Calls `update_interpolants` after validating `data`, before the
        VC state is set up.

        nt : int, optional
            Number of time points to evaluate the interpolants over the interval [tmin, tmax] (default is 1001).

        Notes
        -----
        - Each subplot corresponds to a control waveform (e.g., '<coil>_ref').
        - Interpolated curves are plotted in navy; raw data points are shown in red.
        - Axis labels include units where applicable.
        - Useful for debugging or validating the interpolation quality.
