        Calculate the Green functions of the vessel normal modes.

        If ``I_m`` contains the physical metal currents and ``I_d`` contains
        the normal-mode currents, the current transformation is

        ``I_m = Pmatrix @ I_d``.

        Since the physical-coil Green functions satisfy
        ``psi = I_m.T @ G_m``, substitution gives

        ``psi = I_d.T @ Pmatrix.T @ G_m``.

        The modal Green functions are therefore ``Pmatrix.T @ G_m``.  The
        inverse transformation is instead used to recover modal currents from
        physical currents and must not be applied to the Green functions.
