        - Geometry-related arrays (e.g. `R`, `Z`, `vertices`, `filaments`) are

        - The `greens` dictionary is shallow-copied:
            - Safe usage: replacing entries (e.g. `greens["psi"] = new_array`)
            - Unsafe usage: in-place modification (e.g. `greens["psi"][:] = ...`)
        - This copy is therefore *not fully independent* and should be used only
        when immutability assumptions hold.
        - The attribute `control` is currently assigned from `self.turns`
