        Update this machine in place from direct data dictionaries or pickle paths.

        This accepts the same machine description inputs as
        :func:`freegsnke.build_machine.tokamak`, but applies the new geometry to
        the existing object and refreshes derived FreeGSNKE machine attributes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        active_coils_data : dict, optional
            Dictionary containing the active coil description.
        passive_coils_data : list, optional
            List containing passive structure descriptions. If omitted, no
            passive structures are added.
        limiter_data : list, optional
            List of limiter boundary points.
        wall_data : list, optional
            List of wall boundary points. If omitted, the limiter is used as the
            wall.
        magnetic_probe_data : dict, optional
            Dictionary containing magnetic probe descriptions.
        active_coils_path : str, optional
            Path to a pickle file containing the active coil description.
        passive_coils_path : str, optional
            Path to a pickle file containing passive structure descriptions.
        limiter_path : str, optional
            Path to a pickle file containing limiter boundary points.
        wall_path : str, optional
            Path to a pickle file containing wall boundary points.
        magnetic_probe_path : str, optional
            Path to a pickle file containing magnetic probe descriptions.
        refine_mode : str, optional
            Refinement mode for extended passive structures. Defaults to ``"G"``.
        preserve_currents : bool, optional
            If True, currents for labels that are present in both the old and new
            machine descriptions are copied onto the updated coil objects.

        Returns
        -------
        Machine
            This machine object, updated in place.

        Notes
        -----
        This method updates only machine-level state. If this machine is already
        attached to an equilibrium, use
        :meth:`freegsnke.equilibrium_update.Equilibrium.update_machine_description`
        instead so equilibrium Greens functions and limiter masks are refreshed.
        Existing nonlinear solver objects should be reinstantiated after a
        geometry change because they cache machine-dependent matrices and mode
        decompositions.

        ----------
        coil_name : str
            Existing active coil/circuit label to replace.
        active_coil_data : dict
            Machine-description entry for ``coil_name``. This is the same data

        preserve_current : bool, optional
