    """
    Build the resistance (R) and inductance (M) matrices for the machine within the tokamak
    object. This will construct R and M for the active coils (and any passive structures).

    If already present, they will not be re-calculated.



            # for coil-coil flux
            # mutual inductance = 2pi * (sum of all Greens(R_i,Z_i, R_j,Z_j) on n_i*n_j terms, where n is the number of windings)

            # note that while the equation above is valid for active coils, where each filament carries the nominal current,
            # this is not valid for refined passive structures, where each filament carries a factor 1/n_filaments of the total current
            # and for which a mean of the greens (rather than the sum) should be used instead, which is accounted through the 'multiplier'


            # resistance = 2pi * (resistivity/area) * (number of loops * mean_radius)
            # note the multiplier is used as refined passives have number of loops = 1

    Parameters
    ----------
    tokamak : class
        The tokamak object.
    rebuild : bool, optional
        Recalculate and replace existing resistance and inductance matrices
        even when ``tokamak.coil_resist`` or ``tokamak.coil_self_ind`` already
        exist. This should be set when the machine geometry has been updated in
        place.
    changed_coils : list of str, optional
        Coil/circuit labels whose geometry or metadata changed. When existing
        matrices are available and the coil ordering has not changed, only the
        resistance entries and mutual-inductance rows/columns involving these
        labels are recalculated.

    Returns
    -------
    tokamak : class
        Returns an object containing the (new) R and M data.
