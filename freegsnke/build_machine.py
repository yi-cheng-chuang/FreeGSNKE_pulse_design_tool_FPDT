def copy_tokamak(tokamak: Machine):
    """
    Create a copy of a tokamak Machine object with controlled deep/shallow copying.

    This function duplicates the core Machine object while carefully controlling
    which internal structures are shared and which are copied. It is intended to
    produce a new independent tokamak instance suitable for simulation branching
    or parameter variation.

    Copy behaviour:
        - Uses `tokamak.copy()` as the base object copy.
        - Performs shallow copies of coil container structures.
        - Copies selected numerical arrays using `copy_into`.
        - Shares some reference-type attributes (e.g. probes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tokamak : Machine
        Original tokamak machine object to be copied.

    Returns
    -------
    Machine
        New tokamak instance with copied geometry and selected attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    - `coils_dict` is shallow-copied (dictionary structure copied, values shared).
    - `coils_list` is shallow-copied (list container copied, objects shared).
    - `coil_resist`, `coil_self_ind`, and `current_vec` are copied using
      `copy_into` (typically deep or array-level copy depending on implementation).
    - Cached machine-description data and update metadata are copied so direct
      machine-description updates remain available on the new object.
    - `probes` is shared by reference (not copied).
    - This function does not guarantee full independence of all mutable
      substructures unless `copy_into` enforces deep copying.
